## üéØ Core Features

*   **Beautiful Output**: Generates clean, colorful, and readable directory trees.
*   **Depth Limiting**: Control how many levels deep the tree goes (`-L`).
*   **Advanced Filtering**: Ignore or include specific files/folders using powerful patterns (`--ignore`, `--pattern`).
*   **Code Viewer**: Display the contents of all detected code files right in your terminal (`--code`).
*   **Fine-Grained Control**: Exclude specific files from the code viewer, even while showing others.

treely

# Generate a tree for a specific project, only 2 levels deep
treely ./my-project -L 2
```

#### **Advanced Filtering**

```bash
# Ignore common clutter like 'node_modules' and '__pycache__'
treely --ignore "node_modules|__pycache__"

# Show only Python and Markdown files in your project
treely --pattern "*.py|*.md"
```

#### **Using the Code Viewer**

```bash
# Show the tree AND the content of all detected code files
# (This is great for sharing a project's context)
treely --code

treely --ignore "node_modules" --code "package.json|package-lock.json"
```
